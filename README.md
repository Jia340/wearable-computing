# Processed dataset of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The purpose of this project is to pre-process the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset and generate a tidy dataset for later analysis. Please see the codebook in this repo for more information about the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset and citations. 

###The dataset includes the following files:

- run\_analysis.R: an R script for data processing. The script will merge the training and the test sets, extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation, and create a tidy data set with the averaged value of each variable for each activity and each subject. The output of this script is a dataset named "wearable_computing_tidy.txt", which is a tab-separated file with column names. 

- CodeBook.md: the codebook of the project. This file was generated by modifying the original codebook of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. Please see this file for more information about the project, the original dataset and the processed data.
